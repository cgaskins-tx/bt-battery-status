Bluetooth Battery Status Command Line Utility

This is a very simple Go Lang program that uses the Linux command "upower' to gather the percentage of remaining battery for each native bluetooth device and display it.

I have only tested this on Ubuntu 24.04

Sample Output:
--
Bluetooth Device Battery Status

Chris Gaskinsâ€™s Keyboard
Battery Remaining:  80%
 
BT4.0+2.4G Mouse
Battery Remaining:  81%
